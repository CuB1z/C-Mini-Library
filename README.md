# C Library for emulating Terminal Commands ðŸ“š

C library developed for a university project that emulates the behavior of some terminal commands. The commands that are "emulated" are:
- `head`: Prints the first 10 lines read from standard input or the number of lines specified by the user.
- `tail`: Prints the last 10 lines read from standard input or the number of lines specified by the user.
- `longlines`: Prints the number of lines specified by the user that are the longest in the input.

## ðŸš€ Usage
To test the library, you can compile the `test.c` file with the following command:
```bash
./compila.sh
```

Then, you can run the compiled file with the following command:
```bash
./test -<function> <number> 
```

Where `<function>` is the function you want to test and `<number>` is the number of lines you want to read. For example:
```bash
./test -head 5
```
