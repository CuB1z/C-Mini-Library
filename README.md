# C Library for emulating Terminal Commands 📚

## 📝 Description
C library developed for a university project that emulates the behavior of some terminal commands. The commands that are "emulated" are:
- `head`: Prints the first 10 lines read from standard input or the number of lines specified by the user.
- `tail`: Prints the last 10 lines read from standard input or the number of lines specified by the user.
- `longlines`: Prints the number of lines specified by the user that are the longest in the input.

## 🚀 Usage
To test the library, you can compile the `test.c` file with the following command:
```bash
./compila.sh
```

Then, you can run the compiled file with the following command:
```bash
./test  [-head | -tail | -longlines] [lines number (OPTIONAL)]
```
